# HikariWatcher

A handful plugin made for discord bot devs who uses hikari and lightbulb.
This beautiful module watches over your Extensions/Plugins all the time saving you from the pain of re-running the bot again and again while making a small change. 

This Project is still under development. Feel free to contribute and I will soon push a CONTRIBUTIONS.md and a couple of issues too.

Right now, the existing problem at hand is that the bot needs to be re-run when creating a new Plugin file or folders. Making new Plugin might need a re-run.


Optimising the code is another TO-DO since it sometimes run into TimeOut Error, though I don't know whether it is due to my code or due to some issues with Hikari/Lightbulb. Will have to check.
